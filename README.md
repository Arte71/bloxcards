# The BloxCards card library.

## What?
BloxCards is a trading card game on ROBLOX. It first scripted by Drager980 and is now
maintained by Visleaf. In BloxCards, players can battle bots or each other using their
decks and collect and trade over 900 cards.
The game is heavily inspired by SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, sharing many of
its core mechanics.

## Then?
Everyone agreed it'd be a good idea to let the community handle the stats and effects of
the game's cards.

## Submission guidelines
Every change to every card should be its own commit. Do not cluster changes to multiple
cards into one big commit. Before you commit, test the changes as documented elsewhere.
Do not commit broken files.

## The future
The library files on this repository will eventually be converted to the JSON format so
the server can fetch them on startup.
