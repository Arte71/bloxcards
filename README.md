# The BloxCards card library.

# What?
Bloxcards is a trading card place on ROBLOX scripted by Drager980. In BloxCards,
players can collect and trade over 500 cards and battle with their decks. The game is
heavily inspired by SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, sharing many of its core
mechanics but also adding some of its own (such as the inability to use white icons
as any icons).

# Then?
Everyone agreed it'd be a good idea to let the community handle the stats and effects of
the game's cards.
