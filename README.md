# The BloxCards card library.

# What?
Bloxcards is a trading card place on ROBLOX scripted by user Drager980. In BloxCards,
Players can collect and trade many cards and battle with their decks. The game is heavily
inspired by SNK vs. Capcom Card: Fighters Clash, sharing many of its core mechanics but
also adding some of its own (such as the inability to use white icons as any icons).

# Then?
Everyone agreed it'd be a good idea to let the community handle the stats and effects of
the game's cards.
