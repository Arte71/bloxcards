# The BloxCards Card Library

BloxCards is a trading card game on ROBLOX.
The game was first developed by Drager980; it is now maintained by Visleaf.
In BloxCards, players can play duels against each other or AI, build their
own decks and collect and trade cards.
The game is heavily inspired by SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash,
stealing many of its core mechanics.

The BloxCards community manages the card library via this repository.

## Contribution Guidelines
Every change to every card should ideally be its own commit.
Try not to cluster changes to multiple cards into one big commit.
Multiple small commits go into one big pull request; keeping the
changes seperate lets people easily assess what's being changed.

Test every change as documented in AssetTest.lua and CardLibraryTest.lua.
